My friend wants me to recover his password. He only has the hash and the format of the password.

He ways the hash was 72a2e66fe3295d8887d95c220de7353a.

The format is: ccdCdC

Where c is lowercase letter, C is uppwercase, and d is digit.

I've asked an expert, he said I can generate a wordlist from that format, and try using a hash cracking tool like Hashcat or JTR.

I'm a newbie, could you help me recover the password?

The flag is in the forat: CSC{password}
