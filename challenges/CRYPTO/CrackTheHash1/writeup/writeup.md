# CSC RamadanCTF Crypto challenge 3

A hash is a value generated by a function that can't be reversed. Thus, decrypting or reversing a hash is nearly impossible. 

A solution for this is called hash cracking. It's where you try different possible input values so that the hash of one of them is correct.

One of the tools known for this is John The Ripper. This tool takes a file that includes hash(s) inside, a wordlist, and the format of the hashes inside that file.

Here's the solution to solve this challenge with the files provided.

```john --format=Raw-MD4 --wordlist=wordlist.txt hashes.txt```
